  CAdir is a script for managing an x509 Certificate Authority, offering
  request signing and queries of the CA.

  CAdir receives the request or query parameters on standard in, locks the CA
  with a POSIX lock and performs the requested action. One use case for CAdir
  is as an SSH forced command, allowing nodes in a cluster of computers to
  concurrently make authenticated requests of the CA.


                                                              Command Language
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <request>     = sign :<request bytes>     # Sign the request.
                  | sign CA :<request bytes>  # Sign as a subordinate CA.
                  | crl                       # Get the CRL.
                  | cert                      # Get the CA cert.


                                                                    Dir Layout
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Dir layout should be close to the default layout of OpenSSL's CA tools.
    One additional directory is created in the CA's directory, `CAdir', that
    contains locks, logs and configuration.

      demoCA/CAdir/log
                  /lock
                  /syslog     # Log to syslog if this file contains "true".

    If the directory `conf' exists, either in the CA's directory or under
    `CAdir', it is searched for files with names like `extensions' and other
    CA sounding names; these are used as options for the requests based on
    their names.

      demoCA/conf/extensions
                 /openssl.cnf
                 /...other OpenSSL files...
